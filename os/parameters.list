dns_nameservers A comma-separated list of IP numbers of name servers.
dns_search A comma-separated list of domains to search for incomplete domains.
static_host_interface Set to an interface number, that inteface will be statically configured with all IP numbers reported by DNS for the host name.  This can be used to configure IPv6-only hosts or assign multiple IP numbers on the same interface during cloud-init, as the --net ip option only allows a single IPv4 number.
